Our mission is to get students involved in the community by providing easy access to service opportunities

VOCAL is a student-run organization based out of Oak Mountain High School, that operates all throughout the Greater Birmingham Area. Our goal is to engage students in community service by making volunteer options as readily accessible as possible. Our website offers a catalog of affiliated as well as unaffiliated organizations to provide the most comprehensive selection of volunteer opportunities in the Greater Birmingham area.

Making low-commitment volunteer activities available to everyone is one of our key objectives. Unlike other organizations or clubs at schools, there is no "membership" that you must apply for and commit to. VOCAL does not force any quotas or obligations, allowing for the low-commitment system we work under. We also encourage students to participate in community service by offering a fun environment in which to serve.

Thanks to our affiliates, we get lean about upcoming events and then our staff plans and organizes official VOCAL events. Through school announcements, emails, flyers, and our social medias, we share these events to recruit as much help as possible. Official VOCAL events provide a quick and easy way for affiliates to recruit volunteers, and for students to apply for community service.
